1	28	8.48%	28	"****This action must be chosen unless you spend a Choice Token to avoid it. If all actions on your turn come up with this edict, choose one of those actions from which to permanently remove this.****

Add a tile to the map. Use the free space indicated in Column E (if this is already an existing tile, add it to the map randomizer tab, then come back here and check your available actions again). Place some features on the tile. Leave room for future additions. If your tile is open ocean or coastal, you may add up to two more open ocean tiles. Do not overwhelm these bonus ocean tiles with water features.

New tiles must always be orthoganlly adjacent to existing tiles. Note your tile's coordinates on the tile and add those coordinates to the bottom line of the map randomizer tab."



29	43	4.55%	15	Augment a tile. Use the tile indicated in column D. Add or remove some stuff. Make it enough that people will notice but try not to dominate the tile.



44	49	1.82%	6	"If you have a clever idea for a new action to insert into the game, append it to the list copying the formulae for the previous option, replacing the number in column J with 5. Or you can modify an extant action by appending an 'alternatively' option to the end of a current action.

Alternatively, add two related actions with the number in column J replaced with 3.

Alternatively, you may alter the frequency of one action on this list by adjusting the modifier in column J. You may add or subtract one, effectively adding or removing a single ""card"" from the ""deck"" of actions. You may not go to zero or negative; there must always be at least one ""card"" in the ""deck"" after you take this action."



50	59	3.03%	10	"Spend some time finding someone who'd like to join the game. When you do, invite them to the community and add them to the end of the turn tracker sheet (they start with one Choice Token), and share the game-documents with them. If more than one person wants to play as a result of this process, invite them all!

Alternatively, tag someone other than the next person in line in order to rearrange the turn order. Adjust the turn tracker by changing the turn order column, then select A:H for all active players and then sort range by column A."



60	75	4.85%	16	"Add or augment a description in the 'Map Location Description' file for a named location that was already on the map before your turn. Or do the same with a political entity in the Worldbook.

Alternatively, add a small map of a local site associated with one of the named places to the Map Location Descriptions file."



76	92	5.15%	17	Choose some unnamed feature on the map and give it a name. Add the new label to the map and create an entry in the Map Location Descriptions file with a few sentences (or more!). Feel free to include the new feature in any other appropriate places in the game files.



93	103	3.33%	11	"For the tile indicated in column D, add a table of possible random encounters for someone exploring that tile, to the Random Encounters document.  If that tile already has a random encounter table, change an entry or two on it.

Alternatively, for the tile indicated in column D, add some true, false, and mixed rumors for the 3x3 region surrounding the target tile to the Rumors document. If the tile already has rumors, add some more."



104	119	4.85%	16	"In order to decrease the apparent tiled nature of the map, add a feature that spans the joint between four or more tiles. If you are at a loss, use the tile in column D.

Alternatively, move an extant feature over a little so that it spans two or more tiles.

Alternatively, look for a set of tiles with a jarring or obvious border. Edit 1-4 tiles in an effort to hide the border. You may add features, change colors, use gradients, but go for a subtle improvement to the interface between tiles."



120	136	5.15%	17	"Open the Who's Who document and add a new persona name, an optional picture, and the named map location (related to that persona) to the document. Add an asterisk to the map location named in the Map Locations document.

Alternatively, pick two people on the Who's Who list who weren't created on this turn. Give them each a portrait.

Alternatively, pick someone on the Who's Who list who wasn't created on this turn. Add a character picture and some descriptive text. You can add backstory or update their outlook with current events, or have them react to some other change in the game world."



137	148	3.64%	12	"Edit any action on the list to cause an alteration in how the game works. The theme of the action should be retained, otherwise use your own judgement.

Alternatively, you may alter the occurrence frequency of one option on the list by modifying the range of any option by increasing or decreasing the number in column J by up to +/- 3 from its current value. You may not go to zero or negative; there must always be at least one ""card"" in the ""deck"" after you take this action."



149	169	6.36%	21	"****This action must be chosen unless you spend a Choice Token to avoid it. If all actions on your turn come up with this edict, choose one of those actions from which to permanently remove this.****

Collect three Choice Tokens by adding three to your balance in the Tokens column on the turn tracker worksheet.

You may spend a Choice Token in the following ways:
 - Any time one of your actions tells you what tile to operate on, ignore that instruction and choose any tile you like. (Newly added tiles must still be contiguously connected to old tiles.)
 - You may spend a Choice Token any time you want to take all 3 actions.
 - Instead of taking two random actions, you may also spend one Choice Token to take any one single action of your choice (from the list of possible actions).
 - You may spend a Choice Token to ""reroll"" if you don't like what the RNG has dealt.
 - You may spend three Choice Tokens to jump in and take a turn out of order. You don't skip anyone's turn; you just get an extra go.
 - You may spend a Choice Token to take one of the three actions twice. This consumes your whole turn.
 - You may spend a Choice Token to perform as many of the ""Alternatively"" options on one action card as you like. Taking all of the options consumes only one action."



170	183	4.24%	14	"Pick an entry in the Demography Map and narratively work the information into the Map Locations Document however you see fit. Feel free to embellish. Remove the entry from the Demography map when complete.

If there are no entries left in the Demography Map sheep, remove a reference to the Demography Map from another action. If there are no entries left, archive the Demography Map sheet and make up a completely new action for this one!"



184	193	3.03%	10	Open the Who's Who document and select a name that was present before your turn. Change the map location associated with that person, and add narration explaining why to their section. Update the previously existing information as necessary.



194	204	3.33%	11	"Draw a political border around a section spanning at most three squares. Name the area using the Rock Salt font, feel free to use names from the surrounding area, but add a new name. Use information from the Demography file or Map Location documents, if applicable. Add the name of your political entity to the Worldbook but not the Map Location Descriptions document.

Alternatively, add a description to the Worldbook for a political entity already existing.

Alternatively, grow or shrink one of these previously created polities by one tile. Optionally, explain in your turn report the in-game events leading to that. If you choose to explain, add this explanation to the Worldbook entry."



205	212	2.42%	8	Create something in the tile in column D that connects to any other tile that is at least two tiles away. This can be an object on the map, or entries in the Who's Who, Worldbook, or Descriptions files.



213	221	2.73%	9	"Add a water-feature to the map.

Alternatively, create an outlet from an existing water feature that would allow for the creation or expansion of a civilization.

Alternatively, create or edit an entry in the Map Location Descriptions, Who's Who, Worldbook, or any other files regarding a water-feature. You may name a feature on the map and add a description, or update an existing entry with new information. You may not create an entry without at least a few sentences' worth of prose. Feel free to be florid."
222	223	0.61%	2	"Select an action which has only one chance of of being rolled and propose it be retired from play. All active players have until your next turn to respond with their preference to keep or retire the action. If there is no simple majority the action is retained. Players who do not respond are asumed to vote 'no change'.

Alternatively, reduce the frequency of any one turn action by reducing the modifer in Column J by up to 3. You may not go to zero or negative; there must always be at least one ""card"" in the ""deck"" after you take this action."



224	238	4.55%	15	"Add a double tile to the map- that is, create a 2x1 or 1x2 tile with two coordinates. If sensical, use the free space indicated in Column E (if this is already an existing tile, add it to the map randomizer tab, then come back here and check your available actions again). Put the new tiles adjacent to that edge and place some features on the tiles. Leave room for future additions. Note both of your tile's coordinates on the tile and add both those coordinates to the bottom line of the map randomizer tab.

Alternatively, add a double-sized feature to the map; something that spans two tiles. Feel free to dominate the tiles."



239	243	1.52%	5	Alter the occurrence frequency of one action by changing the modifier in Column J by plus or minus up to five. You may not go to zero or negative; there must always be at least one "card" in the "deck" after you take this action.



244	250	2.12%	7	Write a poem (any style) about this game (any aspect) from the point of view of an inhabitant of the world we're creating or from your own point of view as a player. Share it in your turn report (and more widely if you like). Add this poem to the Poetry document.



251	252	0.61%	2	"Choose one of the other two actions and add the following text inside the quotes at the top:

""****This action must be chosen unless you spend a Choice Token to avoid it. If all actions on your turn come up with this edict, choose one of those actions from which to permanently remove this.****""

This action may never be made mandatory."



253	259	2.12%	7	Take something from the tile in column D and move (or duplicate) it 1 tiles to the Right. If you have to add a tile to the map to make that happen, do so, but copy the background square or use the same background color.



260	267	2.42%	8	"Choose a feature on the tile listed in Column D. It is now dangerous or otherwise somehow a hazard. Update the Map Location Descriptions file with significant details on this dangerous feature.

Alternatively, add a dangerous feature to the tile and document as above.
"



268	282	4.55%	15	"Select an existing tile, named region, or population. Create 1-4 new terms & definitions used by the selected group or area and add them to the lexicon. The new entries should help evoke the character, attitudes, or beliefs of the users. Blessings, curses, titles/positions, elements of religion/folklore/superstition, pastimes, foodstuffs, etc. may be included.

Alternatively, describe a people or group with a shared culture, history, or agenda and add them to a new or existing entry in the Map Locations Document."



283	283	0.30%	1	"Add the tile listed in column E to the map, but stretch yourself artistically (hand-drawing, collage, new digital tool, whatever). And tell us about what you did that's new!

Alternatively, you may alter the occurrence frequency of one option on the list by modifying the range of any option by increasing or decreasing the number in column J by up to +/- 2 from its current value. You may not go to zero or negative; there must always be at least one ""card"" in the ""deck"" after you take this action."

292	299	2.42%	8	WILD CARD! Take any other action you choose.



300	307	2.42%	8	On your turn, you can declare a bounty on a given tile or a given action. In your turn post, mention the tile or action that has the bounty and say that it is worth one Choice Token. Until the bounty is claimed, each person must make mention of any outstanding bounties in their turn post and increment the Choice Token bounty by one. The first player who takes the action or acts on the tile gets all the Choice Tokens. All Choice Tokens come from the supply, not the player stash.



308	312	1.52%	5	Replace an extant tile with a scanned/imaged hand-drawn duplicate. Try to make sure the new image captures the essence and features of the tile being replaced



313	320	2.42%	8	"Some horrific Cosmic Void, a mysterious creeping blackness, is consuming the world. It emerged on tile (4,-5) in the Coral Kingdom. Grow the Void in any direction and location that pleases you in a blob roughly 1/4 of a tile in size. The Void may not pass through any Barrier Walls that have been erected.

Whatever the Cosmic Void consumes is gone from the world and should be listed in the Victims of the Cosmic Void file. Also do whatever other book-keeping is needed to maintain coherence in the documentation."



321	325	1.52%	5	"Look for some unnamed feature on the world map, add a name and update the worldbook with this entry.

Alternatively, open the worldbook and look for a feature that has not been created this turn and add a description"



326	330	1.52%	5	"Bonus turn! Take one or two of the other actions, then take an entire extra turn as though you were just called. Make a separate post with a new turn number and re-roll so that you get three new cards.

***This action may never be purchased with Choice Tokens.***
***This action may never be made mandatory.***
***You may ignore this whenever you like, or if you've taken too many bonus turns.***"
