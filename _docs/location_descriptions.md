Abrasax Tower** (-3,-4)
Notable NPCs: Abrasax, The Tome of Alrathax,

This is the tower of the sky dragon Abrasax the Wise, Abrasax the Untouchable, Abrasax the Merciful, Abrasax the Wastelayer, and its entourage and court. It is impossible to separate fact from rumor when it comes to the merciful and kind sky dragon, who can raise the dead, consume whole villages before the sun is full high in the sky, whose very tears are gold and can command the magic of the sky and the elves.

Indisputably, Abrasax is not to be disturbed by anything insignificant. Only it can say for certainty what is significant, but the path to the tower is paved with bones. Tread with caution.

Alyssa’s Prison* (4,0)
Notable NPCs: Alyssa,

The original name of this prison is lost to history. It is now named after the legendary hero, said to be the only successful escapee. Her tale inspires regular, often fatal attempts to usurp her legacy.

The now-forgotten sorcerer who originally controlled the land and built the prison to be a lynchpin in said sorcerer’s attempt at becoming a lich by draining the life forces of the prisoners during a specific celestial event decades ago. Presumably it didn’t work, since there’s no record of mass deaths in the prison and there’s been no sign of the sorcerer since Alyssa’s escape a century ago.

Arnast’s Keep (1, 10)
Who can be mad enough to build the northernmost keep? Arnast is your man, he was once a very rich man, but one day he decided to build his residence in the north, surrounded by snow and ice he spend much of his fortune building his crazy dream.

When the Keep was finished he enter along with all his family and servants, how they get food? Is still a mystery as the few visitors Arnast get get always a warm welcome with many delicious food and wine

Augre Inukshuk (0,10)

Blank

Barrow of the Great Khan (2,-1)
This hill hides the secret tomb of Kortus Giilini, Khan of Khans, destroyer of all who stand, ruler of the known world -- dead these seven centuries. People whisper of the treasures he accumulated and which were buried with him and his 200 concubines. And occasionally, hearty tomb robbers set out to plunder Kortus’ tomb but none return from the challenge.

Baxter’s Bay (3,-1)
Maximillian Baxter, to some a great explorer, to others a conqueror, first landed his ship Traxx here after his arduous trek across the sea. Now, the bay is a good place for fishing. It was once a prime spot for incoming ships from across the sea, but now they prefer the river mouth to the north, to the delight of the local fishermen.

Bay of Lost Souls (-7,-6)
It is never quite clear if the name of the bay refers to the sorcerous warrior-dolphin tribes who live here, or to their victims. There is a legend that the dolphins themselves were an incredibly vicious tribe of humans that have been cursed into dolphin form, but there are also those who say these stories were started by the dolphins themselves.
Regardless, the pod-tribes who live here now wield magic and artillery with equal skill, but their preferred piracy tactic is to use themselves as armored living torpedoes to take down any vessel they choose; once the ship is down and the crew drowned, the spoils are ripe of the picking.

Beads of Jupiter (-9,-5)
Six islands, more regular than they have a right to be, all in a chain. There’s a shallow rime of dirt between the air and the scoria that makes the core of the islands that hosts mats of fungi and the occasional tuft of grass. The fisheries around the Beads are rich, but the place is bad luck for sailors so it is largely unexploited. Sea birds take ample advantage.
Blazeholm** (-1,-8)
Notable NPCs: Mirian Byzantine,  Kilgrave,
This small fledgling kingdom has named itself after the naturally-occurring giant walls of fire that constantly erupt out of the ground in its territory. Until recently, the kingdom kept mostly to itself, but for some unknown reason Lord Regent Abel Yulent has started pushing for more expansion into nearby territories, putting it in conflict with the nearby kingdoms.
The expansion of the kingdom has continued at a slow but continued pace. With the hazard developing to the southeast of the kingdom, Lord Regent Yulent has decided to pursue a southern expansion moving Blazeholm closer to the ocean. The possibility of expanding the kingdom to the ocean was at first a feared decision by the citizens, being that they rely so heavily on the use of fire as a way of life. But the Lord Regent has assured them, the use of fire can only be culled by water and to possess both would be a huge advantage for the developing future of their kingdom.

Blood-Harvest Tower (3,-3)

The inhabitants of this tower are prisoners from the three closest political entities. Having decided that any type of corporal punishment was torture, they left the Lords of the Blood Harvest Tower as the willing enforcers of the laws and rules.
Boiling Oasis (0,2)
Home to a large community of fire lions, the boiling oasis is anything but. Beware the gentle fragrance of the delicate smoke blooms, for as soon as you can smell them, the pride can smell you. Long ago, a local tribe would send their young women there as tests of their spiritual strength. She who so returned because their next leader.

Brakel Bay (9,2)
Brakel Bay is known for its exotic beaches of jeweled sands, fantastic rums and liqueurs, calming winds, alluring people, and a red tower capable of focusing throwing massive alchemical weapons in defense of its colorful fruits, seductive musics, and breath-taking sunsets.

Bricklayers Canal** (5,1)
Notable NPCs: Lockmaster Imur N'lantha,

No one is sure the true origin of the name for this canal, but it is used by both traders to access Xitz and Burncrab Dale, and the bandits to raid them.

The Bridge of Broken Hope (-9,-4)
No description yet.

Bridges Of Chazonkómena* (-9,-3)
Notable NPCs: Etta Whitegrief,

Etta Whitegrief makes her home here. She is one of the leaders of this community, tasked with sourcing some of the most significant woods and other materiel for the Bridges’ extensive bas-reliefs.

	Recently, a horrific plague has been spreading through the bridge city after an attack by fish men. The sick become glassy of eye, short of breath, and develop lesions on their skin, which eventually resemble the scales of a marine creature. These victims usually die gasping for breath, but a growing number are disappearing. Family members report seeing some of them stumbling down toward the shore, and not returning.

Bronze Archipelago* (-2,-10)
Notable NPCs: Kilgrave,

Comprised of Faith Island, Hope Island and Trick Island (along with the infamous Bronze Island that gives the archipelago its name). This collection of islands is home to the dragon Kilgrave (currently visiting Blazeholm).

The Burn (-1,0)

	For as long as there has been history of the land, The Burn has been smoldering. There is heat beneath the surface - no scholars have found any explanation. The explanation of the natives - that it was the result of an angry and lustful god - has been scoffed at.

	Expeditions into the Burn are common, due to the strange metals and crystals that form there. Very few are successful because of the extremely adverse conditions and the large amount of elemental beasts wandering the land. Mining companies often hire adventurers to protect the mining crews.

Burncrab Dale* (3,-1)
Notable NPCs: Braniah Unnyal,

The Burning Keep (4,-4)

Cathesa Cove* (11,1)

Ceriji River (-2,5)
	Lorem some ipsum!

Chazonkómena Archipelago (-8,-4)
The ruins of an ancient civilization are spread throughout these islands, choked by jungle and zealously guarded by the remnants of a once great people. Autonomous magical servants continue their last instructions amidst collapsed buildings, haywire enchantments create pocket environments where anything can happen, fierce jungle predators have adapted to the magical threats, adopting magic of their own. And scattered in sheltered areas the savage offspring of the survivors jealously protect the remnants of their civilization from outsiders, treasure hunters, and tribes from other islands.

Chazonkómenan Canal (-9,-2)
Yada yada

Connected Current (-4,2)
A narrow, fast-flowing brook that flows from the Plain of Eternal Storms (-5,0) to the Tiwaye Delta (-4,2).  It was originally thought to be just a part of the delta, until it was found to flow in a different direction than the rest of the delta.  It also carries a charge which gives a shock to anyone when they come in contact with it.

The Coral Kingdom (4,-5)
Update:  A mysterious void has began to form over the Coral Kingdom. A dark, black thickness that has not beginning and no end….Only the darkness..
The Coral Kingdom has been written on sea maps since memory, but no one knows its true nature.

Cracked Lands (-2,-2)
Ancient geothermal forces cause constant upheavals in this area. Typically, the unstable appearance keeps out way travellers, but occasionally, those on the run or looking for a shortcut fall prey to shifting grounds and erupting lava.

Cranston’s Reef (3,-1)

Due to some mysterious events Cranton’s Reef has lost the a portion of its middle.


Dakuwaqa’s Den (8,-1)

Decane’s Respite (3,-12)


Deep Rift (2,7)
There is a stupendously deep rift in the floor of the sea here and at the very bottom is a thin point between our world and some other. Occasionally things travel between the worlds. It’s fine if a whale leaves our world, but when a squad of crab-shelled giants enters ours, they can make some trouble


Dizzying Aerie (2, -7)

The Dizzying Aerie is home to the best observatory in the southern continent. The Dizzying Aerie, jagged peaks whose summits ascend higher than the clouds.


Douban Keep (0,-3)

Eyes of Marah (9,-2) to (10,-2)
A century before the Time of Dawn, there were Jath and Mara, the last remaining wizards of the Age. Mara had determined herself to open a gateway to the Plains of Fire in order to cleanse the world so that she may rebuild it again to suit her own twisted desires. In the final moments of her preparations, which had taken place over the course of seven seasons, Jath interfered with the ritual, bending the gate back upon the world, utterly destroying both wizards, and rending two great holes in the earth, one at the site of Mara’s ritual, and one where Jath stood in sacrifice. To this day, the inner walls of these two great craters still burn with arcane fire, a caution to those who would call upon the powers of the outer realms.


Fallen Star* (-2,-3)
Notable NPCs: Dinrael Bospher,



Temple of the Fallen Star


Dinrael Bospher’s expedition encampment.




Women of the Dying Flame









Feast of the Butterflies* (1,-6) and (2,-6)
Notable NPCs: Shailana,
Year-round, day and night, an explosion of color undulates over a small group of hills - butterflies of every size and description congregate here in numbers so vast as to obscure the ground. It’s a mystery what they feed on, but the mass remains constant, neither growing nor diminishing, even as individual bugs join and part, emerge and die.

A legendary site, and a pilgrimage destination for many faiths, it is watched over by a lineage of caretakers called Shai. From time to time, they take in a pilgrim to maintain their numbers, or send a youth to seek their fortune in the wider world. Like the Feast, the Shai maintain their numbers at around ten.

Font of Cold Fortune (-2,6)

The Forest of Swords (0,6)
The “forest” is actually a small crater that was the site of an ancient battle. Littered across the lands are the weapons of the deceased, each bathed in the blood of their owner’s enemies, each carrying a unique enchantment. Those who seek to claim these artifacts should beware, because the ghosts of the fallen warriors still carry their ancient grudges.

Forgotten Canal (6,3)

Fort Hampoole (0,-4) and (1,-4)
After Colonel Hampoole’s disastrous failed siege of Xir, he retreated South. Fearful of reprisal, he has his engineers construct a replica, with the hope it would be similarly impregnable.

Garuda Jagah (1,7)
The harsh cliff faces of this seashore region are home to the Garuda, a colony of winged people. Their legends claim they are the unwanted children from the various unions of Furies and seamen, Great Eagles, wyverns, and other creatures. Originally dumped on the rocks to die, they have instead thrived gathering fish, seaweed and crustaceans from the waves below, and tending gardens on the bluffs above. Giving credence to their origin myths are the fact that there is great physical differences between individuals; some appearing more bird-like, others scaled or leathery-skinned like the Furies. Those with human features and arms in addition to their wings are most common, perhaps because they were best able to survive until the tribes became well enough established to support the less adept offspring.
There is a complex tribal structure that is part arranged marriages, part caste system, and part parliament. Their language is easy to pick up, likely due to the wildly disparate mouths of these people. Interestingly, they do not make boats of any kind and view seafaring folk with a combination of dangerous respect and wary superstition.

Gate of the Gods* (0,-6)
Notable NPCs: The Crazy Old Hermit,

Towering stone and crystal spires jut from a glassy plane forming a mindbending structure surrounded by craters. Legend tells of a time when the gods walked the earth and fought in this place, whether to open or to close the doorway to their realm, and which side won is a matter of debate among priests and scholars.

Gkeezshaz / Sìdh Mòr Túr (0,1)
	This tower is the seat of power for the fairy court controlling the Free State of Leng. Recently, the Goblin armies have captured- and renamed it. The defensive glamours will make it hard for the Goblins to make use of the tower without refocusing their shamanic strength.  (Note this entry appears twice under both names. Please update both when needed.)

Goblin Woods* (1,1)
Notable NPCs: Alae’im,

The goblin woods are named so because they were said once to have been inhabited by a tribe of those most vile and pernicious of the magic folk. This was so long ago, however, that nobody is really sure that goblins ever existed here. One thing is sure, however, there are ruins deep in the woods that everybody shuns, and they have an inhuman cast to them. Strange noises can be heard day or night, and crows seem to take to these woods in great numbers.



There is an old woman who lives just inside the edge of the Goblin Woods who keeps to herself. Few actually believe the stories that people tell about her having strange powers. On the other hand, few people bother her unless they think they need something from the woods. Apparently she knows more about the woods than any other, and can find her way around all but the ruins.

Although goblins do not live in these woods, trolls are known to live here. They use the dense foliage to hide from the sun. Lumberjacks that collect wood from these woods occasionally encounter these fell beasts.

God’s Mouth (2,2)
	This is the cavern to which the River Traxx flows; it swallows the river. It is a limestone cave at the base of a short cliff lined with numerous stalactites and stalagmites that are called God’s Teeth by the local spider people. Each evening at dusk, thousands of bats fly from the cave in search of bugs in the swampy margins of the river. There is no history of expeditions into the cave for everyone knows it is sacrilege.

Gofi (-10,-1)
IPSUM IPSUM


The Great Inland Sea (-10,0) through (-11,-2)
Update: The Great Inland Sea now has a hazard that developed in the Northwest part just off the coast. The earth shook violently, just north of the Thessaline lands, no one know exactly what the outcome was until a group of Thessalians looking to relax at the shores of the sea for a day, made their way there and witnessed the whirlpool for themselves.
Update: Not too long after the first trembles of the earth, it shook once more; the Thessalians immediately made their way to the shores once more, to see a second great sinkhole in the water had appeared, this time closer to the southern shore of the great sea. They prayed that there would not be a third.

Grendarff Shoals (3,-9)
	A broad stretch of sand bars, shallows, and rocks presents a hazard to all naval traffic.  More than 50 shipwrecks have been recorded in the area, with hundreds of lives lost and uncounted treasures scattered over the area.
A few tiny, uninhabited islands are dotted through the shoals, but none so large as to be able to maintain any plant life.  A number of them, however, are large enough to provide nesting places for sea birds, and may also be visited occasionally by migrating seals and walruses.

Grfog Swamp (-2,-1)

Guihe’s Respite (5,-7)
This tiny island is the home for a small population of fiercely independent golems, homunculi, steam automatons, clockworks, and organic synths. Long feared or shunned by their creators, one way or another, the beings here revolted, rebelled, or ran away from their creators over the decades.
They intensely value their privacy and liberty, and are willing to violently defend themselves from discovery. Their defenses vary from the conventional to the techno-magical. Nonetheless, a few intrepid explorers or unfortunate souls have landed or shipwrecked here never to be heard from again. Typically they become subjects for literally unhuman experiments.
Despite their capacity and willingness for violence, the population has a very peaceful daily life, developing art, philosophy, science, and arcane theory.

Head of Thos (-2,8) and (-1,8)
One of the titans tasked with forging the world, only Thos’s head remains. Legends speak of it’s body being used to fashion a mountain range, being stolen by a trickster god, or rendered into clay to form the first animals. Whatever the cause, the titan’s head was left, by design or mistake it glowers at the world. Though Thos no longer has lungs to speak, some believe should it ever be given voice it will signal the end of the world.
Recently, the waters near the Head of Thos have become treacherous, as they have begun to flow rapidly into the mouth of the titan’s stone head. Sages have expressed concern not only for the several seafarers who were ensnared by the sudden intake of seawater, dashing their vessels against Thos’s rocky teeth, but some also believe that this is some kind of drawing of breath, in preparation for the speaking of the Ending Word.

High Hills* (0,-1)

Text text text.

Hills of the Sacred Tea* (-1,2)
Notable NPCs: Jade Prelate,
Hole in the World* (1,-1)
Notable NPCs: Dodyrune,


Holozodu (0,0)
	This name applies to three things: The plateau, the boiling lake that makes up much of the plateau’s table, and the island in the middle of the lake. These are all holy places to the Old Ones, the original natives of the continent. Almost none of their ways survive today. The old villages that sit on the shores of the lake are empty, silent witnesses to their old cultures.
	On the island, an ancient temple stands. Very few make the pilgrimage anymore, but those who do claim the experience, while grueling, is very rewarding.
Honeydark Grove (8,-4)
	This island is all that remains of what once was a land bridge. It crumbled and fell into the ocean after a powerful tribe of people from far across the waters came and drew power from the land, leaving it vulnerable and nothing more than a brittle latticework. The island that remains is the original site of this ritual, and the sharp, jagged nature of its edges mean that getting ashore is nearly impossible without magic.

Hypno Squid Mating Zone (-4,7)
Hypno Squid reproduce using complex telepathic virtual experiences, occasional fits of psychic aggression and violent flailing, and also a hectocotylus; which the male may use "merely as a conduit to the female, or he may wrench it off and present it to the female."

Hypno Squid are extremely dangerous and devious enemies, but at least the ones out here are distracted.  They seem to take turns going west to the coast in small groups.  They are tired, happy, and wanting to relax.  Some say this is a good time to ask for favors.  Give them food and your most emotional memory in exchange for lie detection and other telepathic services.  Nearby communities sometimes use them to settle legal affairs.

Imboca** (5,0)
Notable NPCs: Dax, Sorcerer Emeron, Kwan Wildpetal

Imboca is a floating city, made up of rafts and boats, that is protected by a large-range spell that keeps them on the other side of the veil from those who don’t know its secret. The same spell traps those who would wish them harm, sailing forever, unable to leave the sphere of ocean.


Impossible Iceberg (-8,-5)
How an iceberg come this far? That is the question many investigator have done themselves, for many the answer is pretty easy, Magic, but if this is the correct answers only open a large number of questions.
For that reason scholars travel to the now so called Impossible Iceberg looking for the truth behind this strange phenomenon

Invisible Islands** (5,0),(6,0) to (6,1),(7,1)
Notable NPCs: Scoqwyx, K’thrax,

               Sorcerer Emeron found it difficult to travel between his newly formed city of Imboca and the Underdeep East without having to charter a craft for himself. So upon discovering a spell to generate land mass from water he decided to create the Invisible islands. They can only be accessed by the inhabitants at low tide and by Emeron himself, whenever he sees fit.  

These islands can only be seen and used during low tide, used by the inhabitants to cross the sea from Imboca to the Undersea East, it is the only channel they can use to move food and supplies when ships are not able to. The islands do not obstruct sea passage but can be a mode of protection for the coast from extremely large vessels looking to attack or cause harm to the inhabitants who live there.

Ironcoast (5,6)
	This sparsely settled region of salt marshes, mud pits, and scrub brush is infested with monsters. Legend tells of a battle fought long ago which poisoned the land, turning verdant farms into a stinking treacherous wasteland. Its modern name comes from the sailors on passing ships and the captains who maintain discipline by putting troublemakers ashore to survive as best they can until the ship stops on its return trip. An Ironcoast survivor receives the respect of their peers and a bonus from their captain in return for any ancient treasures washed from the battlefield. It is rumored that even greater rewards and danger can be found further inland.

The Islands of Qamr and Najoom (5,-1)
	Lorem ipsum

Islands of Ledolt (3,7)
	The nature has been harsh with this islands, their almost polar environment makes hard for any settlement to establish even with the abundance of gold, but the low temperatures and hostile fauna makes the islands a dangerous place to mine.

Isle of the Furies* (2,6)
Notable NPCs: Sharkrider (Captain Saltrock),

Isle of Worms (6, -9)
Named for the profusion of tubular flowers adorning the vines which grow everywhere, this island is home to large carnivorous frogs ranging from 1 to 3 feet across. Their primary diet is the birds and insects attracted by the worm flower vines, unwary fish swimming in the shallows, and smaller frogs. The people of the island have domesticated frogs and bred several species for meat, hunting, leather, and pets. Cured frog skin makes an excellent stretchy leather that is the island’s primary export. Visitors are cautioned to stay on marked paths near inhabited areas, and are told stories of Boeruckah, a giant albino frog which can speak and tricks the foolish into its mouth.

Issac & Cassi’s Dreamhold* (-7, 1)
Notable NPCs: Cassi,

The Jaw (-2,-6)
The Islands of the Jaw truly are the teeth of an ancient ocean dwelling creature.  The ivory mines and artisans of the jaw are famed throughout the southern seas for the beautiful and intricate carvings they produce.  Inks and steel are major imports as are fruits and land food, though several large barges covered with soil grow vegetables to supplement the inhabitants’ fishing.  There are almost no creatures native to the jaw beyond barnacles and a nearly extinct species of seabird which nests in holes burrowed into the surface ivory.

Jha’Riz Crater (-6,-1 and -5,-1)
	The large area impact site believed to have been created from the battles of giants swallows the land, growing in size every year. Minerals never found in large quantities anywhere else have been since mined dry and the veins closed, but with each passing decade newer veins emerge. Attempts at colonizing the site have been met with a string of horrid failures for untold reasons.
Jim’s Hoard* (-3,1)
Notable NPCs: Captain Felicity Moonflower,

Rat-people have long dwelt on the island north of the Sinistratum Strait, west of the Hill of Sacred Tea. It was not until the coming of humans to these lands that they ventured far from their shores. Captain Jim taught them to sail and craft boats of their own. For decades his armada overwhelmed trading, exploration, and military craft, building a prosperous, if oddly sized city on the shores of the island. Outcasts of many races came to call it home, but the rat-people remain the majority of the inhabitants. Jim’s mummified body is carried through the streets on a litter during the spring and fall festivals.

Recently the privateer Felicity Moonflower has come to call the port home, raising the memory of Jim’s piratical hoards in impressionable rat-people minds.
Kali-Ma (-2,9)*
Notable NPCs: Mol Aram,

Asdfasdfasfdasdfasdfasdf

Kelp Jungle (-11,-6)
Foo

Khá (5,-3)
The twin islands of Khá, Khá Iz and Khá Dez have a rich history steeped in folklore and conflict. Both populations of peoples are distantly related, so long ago the islands may have been one island. There is a strong taboo with intermarriage, but it is not wholly unknown. The rivalry runs deep, with war, murder, raids, psychic maelstroms, and summoned beasts.
Khá Dez currently has the upper hand after laying waste to a huge swath of land on Khá Iz with star magics a few generations back. The matriarchal leaders of both islands sharpen their knives and yet continue their conflict. Khá Iz is rumored to be working on a retaliation song, one that takes more than one generation to properly channel the force.
Both of the Khá peoples are deeply spiritual and are known for their exquisite music. Most of their food comes from the ocean, which neither island would dream to desecrate. As such, they deal little with the mainlands apart from trade or the idealistic young people who tire of war and become world-wanderers.

The Knowing Coral (8,0) + (8,1) + (9,1)
Possibly one of the oldest entities in the world, this composite being exerts a strong mental influence on sailors and sea creatures for miles around it. In particular the coral seeks metals, either in the form of tribute paid for safe passage, or extracted from the blood of those who wander too close.
Koestler’s Cache (1,2)
	The mythical location of a renowned bandit stronghold long-ago buried by a desert storm, along with all those unfortunates present at the time. The Cache is said to contain untold riches in pilfered loot, including the mighty instruments of royal office previous held by the King of Granite. Many have perished while wandering the desert in search of its now obscured site.

La Joya Mountains (1,3)
           These mountains are infested with the slug-like larva of a tribe of earth elementals. their burrowing exposes harder stone, gems and ores which are gathered and traded by kobolds who live in the larger caves.    

Lagoon of the World Tree** (-3,-3)
Notable NPCs: Great Kossuth, The Yewcrown, Datur Wyrdtoci,


No matter what damage is done to this tree by mundane means, the damage is always healed overnight. Those who do harm the tree tend to come to nasty ends, however.

Lake of Echoes (3,1)
This was originally named for the way sounds spoken on one end carried to the opposite bank. As sound is simply waves, it was soon discovered waves in the lake displayed the same property. This was mostly a curiosity until a large storm on the north side of the lake caused it to overflow its banks, and the same happened on the south side without any storm present. An additional causeway was constructed down the road from Northbridge after the previous path was submerged.

Land of the Dunestalkers (-1,3)
The Dunestalkers are strange undead lizardmen who burrow beneath the sands by day but arise to chase and devour travelers in the dark of night. It is whispered that a small cadre of living lizardmen have preserved their civilization for thousands of generations beneath the shifting sands. Every spring, when the wind changes, many dedicated salvagers and sand-divers gather to seek treasures. Every summer, some come back with scraps of beautiful stonework and pieces of metal artifacts. There is something below the sands.


Leng (0,0)

	Jutting out from the edge of the plateau of Holozodu is the massive stone head of Leng, towering over the valley at an impossible size. Pouring from its mouth is a torrent of boiling water into a deep basin, known as the Maw of Leng, which never fills and mysteriously cools the torrent from Leng to a bearable level. The resulting steam shrouds the land in mist, hiding the 40 empty, cyclopean stone builds that surround the Maw.  

	A young queen fairy has installed her court in the area, taking advantage of the mist that surrounds the region her fairies patrol the surroundings and attack in the fog those who consider dangerous.

CAUTION  -  CAUTION  -  CAUTION  -  CAUTION
All travelers are warned of the hazard located in the vicinity of coordinates (-8,1).  Alternate travel plans and avoidance of the region are highly recommended.

Sharp, shiny shards of silvery substance are strewn across the area.  These splinters are thought to capture parts of existential essence and transform them into their polar opposites.

The Mirrorspill is a dangerous inter-dimensional fissure which has cleft into the present reality.  Verromancers have come from far away to study the phenomenon and attempt to determine whether it can be controlled.  

Investigations are being carried out to determine whether Issac and Cassi are victims of the mirrorspill.

Mount Fotio (4,4)
A newly formed mountain, compared to those in the rest of the world, this one sprang from the ocean floor just east of the empire of Verranchass and has not stop growing in size since. It spews volcanic ash and lava at the beginning of the full cycle of the Red Moon, then abruptly falls into a short slumber through the rest of the phases only to wake again when the Red disk appears in the sky.
In the beginning the trembles from Fotio were small, the moon cycles were short and the mountain was too distant from any of the continents to be thought of issue, but now that the mountain has grown large enough to be seen from any of the surrounding land masses, the empires have started to take notice of Mount Fotio and its clock like cycles. The trembling caused by the volcano when it does awakens have started to create larger waves that crash along the coast and shorelines of the islands and continents surrounding it.   

Mount Goragas (-5,-7)
	An active volcano with a complex internal structure.

Netzali´s Eye (-11,-3)
	Around a clear a group of bronze skinned men gather to offer sacrifices to their god Netzali, at this place, they believe his god watch for them directly.
New Blaze* (0,-7)
Notable NPCs: Se’Fowin Povoway,

Continuing with the expansion of BlazeHolm, Lord Regent Abel Yulent has decided to create a new village north of the city but just east of the mountains pushing into Sirrithial territory. This act has caused further mistrust of his kingdom and dissention between BlazeHolm and the surrounding kingdoms.

Nila Upspout (-4, -5)
Sailors often talk about a concentrated vortex of water near the southwest edge of Espand. It differs greatly from other waterspouts in the area in that it isn’t connected to any clouds and is never the center of any storms. Talk is rumored of sending scholars to investigate the phenomenon, but no one has risked the danger thus far.
Northbridge (3,2)
The Bridge of the Stoneway, as the Northbridge was once called, was built originally by the Children of Stone as a causeway across the Taltathis River on the King’s Road. When the founders of Silverworth were granted their land by the King of Granite, the price was simple; to maintain the bridge so that travel into the West would never be impeded for the Children of Stone. When the last Children of Stone made their way across the bridge into the West an age ago, the true purpose became lost to history and over time has become known simply as the Northbridge.

North Yondalao (-8, -1)
Lorem Ipsem.


The Obsidian Pentad (6,2)
This most strange site consists of four apparently six-pointed obsidian structures. Local legends insist that the fifth structure reappears unpredictably throughout time. One small faction claims that the structures are not actually six-sided. To their credit, some measurements provide inconsistencies that allow for vigorous academic, spiritual, and dimensional debate.

It does not help matters that the structures rotate slowly over the course of 91 or 92 days, and drift from their locations, with a repeated pattern every 2 years and 47 days.

Caravans never set camp in this area.
Oshind Temple* (1,0)
Notable NPCs: Oshi-Bend,
	Dedicated to Oshind (“The Way”). Oshind is a philosophy that seeks The Divine, a state of being rather than a particular entity. The Oshind believe The Divine is eternal, and that every individual has the potential to achieve it. It rejects the idea of worship, feeling that The Divine in each person seeks a more transcendent goal.
The High Priest of the Oshind Temple is known as Oshi-Bend. Oshi-Bend believes it has transcended the chains of gender on the path to The Divine.

Recently, some of the carved gargoyles at the very top of the Oshind Temple have attained a measure of sentience, and mobility.  Their activity is limited, since they are still fastened to the spire (at least for the time being), and they seem to be conscious and active only for short periods of time and only every couple of days.  However, when they are active, they have been tearing out fistfuls of stone from the building (which they seem to be able to scoop like mud or snow) and hurl it at the supplicants and visitors to the temple.  Several seekers of enlightenment have been killed (and a few dozen more have been injured) from rains of rock pelted down at them from the heights of the temple.  A cordon has been set at what is now hoped to be a safe distance from the Temple, but the gargoyles seem to be growing stronger.

The Oshi-Bend and several senior acolytes have tried to study the gargoyles from a distance, in an attempt to learn whether the quickening of the gargoyles is part of their own personal manifestation of The Divine, or whether it is a malevolent influence that seeks to stifle the achievements of the Oshind.

Our Lord of the Lost Shoals (4,-3)
	Left behind by a defunct group of colonialists, this false deity stands guard over the Lost Shoals, a beacon to warn people away from a hazardous stretch of the waterways. The name of this Lord has been lost to time, only a trivial footnote in archaeological history.
	Quite strangely, in the year (turn) 795, this holy relic and the shoals watched over, all moved markedly south (one tile).



Outlaw Marsh* (2,3) and (2,2)
Notable NPCs: Zarek (left recently),
Named because it’s a common hiding place for those trying to escape the law; the Outlaw Marsh is cursed to lead any who enter it astray, making them hopelessly lost. Luckier victims of the curse generally find themselves stumbling out of the marsh weeks later (or, in some unfortunate cases, earlier); the unlucky ones tend to wind up as dinner for the strange beasts within.
One arcane-minded bandit managed to figure out how to make a talisman that will protect the bearer from the curse, and has begun selling it to well-known bandits in the area. There are small “communities” of thieves living in the swamps completely outside the reach of law enforcement.

The Pained Goddess (7,3)
A forty-foot statue of an unknown goddess, arms outstretched, her face turned upwards to the sky and wearing an expression of extreme pain.

Palm Fastness (-1,-3)

	This desert fortress is maintained by those who have left the Oshind temple for whatever reason.

Passage to the Coral Kingdom (5,-6)

The underwater entrance into the Coral Kingdom. Once the entrance from above was cut off to the city, an underwater passage had to be established and this is it. But no one can gain access to see what is behind the entrance doors, so the nature of this place remains unknown.




Perpetua Cliffs (-8,0)
The ruler of Issac and Cassi’s stronghold decided they needed proper security for the kingdom, so they embarked upon an extraordinary task of heightening the cliffs just to the west and south creating these seemingly never-ending cliffs.

Petrified Ice Giants** (-4,-4)
Notable NPCs: Yondalao, Fanapadryaped,

Lorem Ipsum.

Phelan Wavebreak (2,-2)
Lorem Ipsum.

Phinidaean Gulag (8, 11)
	This frigid labor camp is used by one of the dolphin pod-tribes as an alchemical mine for certain rare substances. All days of the year, all hours of the day, the site is patrolled by the magical war machines of the dolphins and their tattoo magic masters. No prisoners or laborers have ever escaped before their contract is due. Some of the processing is done in a shaped iceberg for non-aquatic residents.

The Pillar of Sorrow (-8,3)
This great stepped pillar reaches into the sky, its round, featureless base thousands of feet in diameter. The higher reaches taper into octagonal and squared shapes, and several openings or windows can be seen, but none have ever been seen to enter or leave.

The Plains of Eternal Storms (-5,0)
  No one of today’s time can remember when there were not storms on the plains, many have stories of how great explorer’s have tried and failed to cross the violent flatlands just east of Lethargia. The people who live there say at night when the night is calm and there is no wind you can hear the thunder crashing to the ground and see the lightning strikes flashing in the distance. From the outside it maybe a beautiful sight, but no one has gotten close enough to see what the plains are actually like. Once landing in the coastal city, Lethargians warn to steer clear and find a route around the plains. That is if you want to finish your journey.  

Plato’s Gap (7,9)

Pomoju Plateau (5,5) and (6,5)
Lorem Ipsum.

Qluan Ait (-2,2)
Around 600 island folks live on the main island and the tiny tertiary land masses. Their culture strictly divides social duties into the four genders present: Boys dive for pearls, men are artisans, women manage the households and lady-men operate the judiciary.
Red Clay Bridge (-2,1)
The Red Clay Bridge was originally thought to be named because of its reddish appearance and the materials it was crafted from, but the surrounding inhabitants know all too well the reasons the bridge was actually given its name. The River Traxx, already known for its treacherous pollution from the city Silverworth, which was also responsible for helping to give this bridge its name.
River Traxx (2,1)
	Polluted from run-off from the nearby city, Silverworth, the River Traxx is populated with twisted mockeries of nature. It is a dreary marsh that stinks of death and decay. The poor folk who live along the river have long since adapted to the corrupted landscape. They tend to be an ugly and savage lot - a necessity given the environs in which they live. This has led to “traxx” being an insult meaning either an ugly or an ignorant person.
	On occasion, odd reactions of the various forms of run-off combine in strange alchemical ways. Scholars from the city like to come and study these effects, which the locals don’t appreciate because they feel these “city folk” have already done enough damage to the area. Plus they don’t treat the locals well; Traxxers don’t cotton to those types of folk ‘round here.

Rocky Beach (6,-4)
A madman wanders the shoreline at Rocky Beach, cursing the waves, and scanning the horizon, searching for ships.  He wears a tattered admiral's uniform and answers to the title of Czar of the Seas.

Rueger Forest (-5,8) and vicinity
	Vast, dense forest of old growth woods covering the northern continent.  The entire region is trackless and unexplored (at least to known scholarship), although a race of reclusive, unknown peoples apparently lives throughout this Forest.  Most encounters with these folk have only been distant sightings, and no communication has taken place.
	Tall, straight trees of impressive height have been found and harvested along the shores of the Rueger Forest, and provide excellent masts for the construction of ever larger ships.  The effort needed to harvest these massive timbers and deliver them to shipyards is extensive, and only small numbers have been harvested to date.

Saar Chasm (-6,1) and (-5,1)*
Notable NPCs: Valacco Seppi,

Horrors that have been captured alive from the polluted River Traxx are brought to the Chasm for safe disposal. Locals have established fight nights, betting on how long a thing will last before plummeting to their death. The currently reigning thing’s favored tactic is to rip off enemies’ limbs and use them as clubs, sometimes grafting a particularly astounding specimen’s limb onto its own multi-limbed body.
Valacco Seppi rules the holding here.

The Sahona Isthmus* spanning (4,1),(5,1),(6,1),and (6,2)
The people of this region are both inlanders as well as aquatic peoples, during the beginnings of their civilization they were at peace with the nomadic inhabitants they encountered when the seasons changed. But the nomads began to ask way too much of tribes, until they had no food stores left to feed themselves in the cold season. In that instant, the Great Chief feeling that his people would become food for the nomads, decided to gather the tribes together to discuss and decide what was needed to help protect the tribes.  So he employed his most intelligent and powerful people from each tribe to explore ways to escape the nomadic peoples. A band of explorers from the southern tribe, located closer to the water, set out on the ocean to find an option for the tribes before the cold season arrived. The band discovered the Invisible Islands, not too far from their shore line. Knowing the nomads had no sense of water travel and no boats to embark on such a journey, reported their discovery to the Great Chief.
 When looking for options, the band almost missed them because they cannot be seen in the light of day.  Not knowing or understanding the true nature of the islands, they decided to  report the islands along with their mystical natural and the Chief anyway. The Chief deciding the safety of the tribes was more important, made the crucial decision with the coming of the next cold season, the northern tribes would begin to gather all of their cold weather stores and make the journey to the islands in preparation for the coming of the rest of the tribes. With this decision,The Invisible Islands become the new winter home of the Sahona Isthmus tribes, somewhat ending the dependence of the nomadic tribes that cross the isthmus during the cold seasons.

Notable NPCs: Kractahl the Bard,
Very few people live in the Scelan Heights, though there is a substantial population of bears, great cats and exotic alpine birds. There is one pass through between High Holy Espana and the Scelan Protectorate, but it is very treacherous due to the native wildlife. Many travellers choose to take the safer route around the mountains, even though the weather is mild enough for airship travel. It’s currently not a popular route.

	This tower is the seat of power for the fairy court controlling the Free State of Leng. Recently, the Goblin armies have captured- and renamed it. The defensive glamours will make it hard for the Goblins to make use of the tower without refocusing their shamanic strength. (Note this entry appears twice under both names. Please update both when needed.)

The Sickle (-9,0)
text text text

Silverworth* (2,1)
Notable NPCs: Zorba,

The biggest population center in the area and a trade city that benefits from straddling the two rivers as well as its large contingent of mages whose forebears founded this city. The dumping of magical waste from this city into the River Traxx has rendered it quite polluted. Magical waste is quite common in this city because magical trinkets of various utility are one of the chief exports of the city. The city is run by the a council of mage-burgher families, who claim lineage to the founding mages of this city. Originally founded when the area contained more goblin denizens than humans, many of the mage-burghers are goblish. This, along with the presence of great deals of money to be made by putting aside their differences, allows humans and goblins alike to rub shoulders in an uneasy truce in a land of tension between the two groups.

Most of this area is populated by human farmers working the area's very fertile soil. Goblins still angry at losing this fertile land in a previous war, ride out from the forest they were pushed to in the West to raid the farmers. The biggest population center is the town of Silverworth, a trade city that benefits from straddling the two rivers as well as its large contingent of mages whose forebears founded this city. The dumping of magical waste into the River Traxx has rendered it quite polluted. Here the presence of great deals of money allows humans and goblins alike to rub shoulders in an uneasy truce as each tries to strike it rich.

Goblin brigands are increasingly coming back closer to Silverworth to prey on travelers and merchant caravans going to and from the city with their rich stocks of money and goods.  The pickings in the farmlands in the outlying areas have gotten more and more meager, and of course everyone knows that goblins don’t go into the nearby Goblin Woods (1,1).   Although the city itself is still a mixture of goblin and human inhabitants, tensions are rising as the outlying areas become more and more dangerous.

One of the main sources of entertainment is the Moonstone Coliseum, a gladiatorial arena created years ago by a now-forgotten former ruler. The arena still sees use, but instead of sending slaves to fight each other to the death, the arena is used as a form of trial-by-combat. Criminals can fight government-paid warriors to the death, and if they survive a few years will be taken off their sentence. Occasionally a desperate individual will volunteer to enter the arena, risking their life to win great riches or eliminate a large monetary debt. Betting on the fights is a popular pastime among the richer classes, and more than one fortune has been gained or lost on a match.
	That’s not to say that they don’t still send slaves to fight each other to the death. It’s just that they have other events now as well.

Sinistratum Straight (-2,0)
Filled with vicious carnivorous fish with the unusual adaptation of thriving in the icy waters, the straight provides protection to the keep on its northwest bank.

The Snarl (3,6)
	The Snarl houses three separate communities. The winged folk who nest on the tops of the masts. They are few, but fierce individual fighters, mages and possibly a cleric. The insectile scavengers who comb the surface of the seaweed and lair within the boats are closer to savages, though they use tools and understand displaying treasure will bring sailors -food- into the snarl. Lastly there is a species of large intelligent eels who prey upon the insects and any unwary travelers who fall into the waves.

Spike of Aralon (-2,-7)
Wharrgarbl
Stones of the Ettins (-3,1)
	Two concentric rows of massive, two-headed giant stone statues face inward across this plain, towards a flat spot of ground where some large building once stood, but now only the remains of the stone foundations are barely visible among the grass. The statues themselves are each carved from volcanic ore. Only bison and the occasional dire wolf dwell amid the statues now. The purpose of the their construction and silent vigil has been lost to the ages.
Strait of Spouts (7,-9)
Why this locale became known as the Strait of Spouts is a mystery to scholars. Not because of the spouts - for the area is rife with water spouts. But it is an open area - not quite the narrows implied by the word Strait. Sailors tell of a phantom shoreline that appears as a mirage in the area, perhaps that creates an illusion of narrows?
Swimming Shores (1,8)
The Swimming Shores are a small group of drifting islands, each populated by various tribes. They are cautious of both strangers and of rival tribe members, but have a complicated set of taboos and traditions governing interrelations.
The islands are actually Dragon Turtles, usually scattered far and wide, but for the last year they have gathered and seen to be swimming around the new island being formed by an erupting volcano. The tribes share similar creation myths, and all are now worried about "The Great Mounting" hinted about in their legends. There is currently a flurry of boat construction and maintenance underway.

Sword’s WaterWay (-1,6)

Thirsting Forest (-7,-5)
	The woods on the island harboring the Bay of Lost Souls (-7,-6) are dangerous. None know if this is because the dark sorcery of the warrior-dolphins have transformed the woods, or if the woods themselves have always been enchanted… regardless their effects cannot be denied.
	The Thirsting Woods are dark– sunlight finds little enough purchase beneath their shaded canopy. The air is thin and cold. This is because the woods leech away warmth and light within them. Travelers would be wise to not linger too long in their shaded depths; there are tales of poor souls who have wandered out of the woods, cold and...hollow.
	Sometimes the woods drink deep.

Thos Island (-2,7) and (-2,8)
While the world was a slumber, The Head of Thos created a small island just southeast of its original location. Only one other has seen this island and only lived long enough to pass the story to another. Is this the beginning of the end? Is the head alive and has it figured out a way to create a voice?

Time Traveling Marina (9,4)
	A popular vacation destination for the wealthied in another time, this Marina dwells in a distortion in space-time. The Marina is not in control of the distortion, which was an accidental byproduct of an experiment in Vault-Town, but it maintains a connection to the time-space it comes from. The Marina is a newcomer to the area, only having been around for a score of years.
Update: The Time Traveling Marina has now started to let interdimensional beings through its gates, these beings are not of this time or of this world. But from a time several hundred years in the future and a whole that seems to parallel this one.

	Eight are perfectly spaced spanning a strait, with the remaining two on the shore. On the eastern bank, one impossibly intricate face looks out across the water. The towers over the water have different faces on each side, decreasing in detail as one moves west. The tower on the western bank is blank.

Tri Star Temple (5,-4)

Trollbruckle (1,3)
This fine stone bridge stands in the foothills of the La Joya Mountains.  It crosses the river here not far from where it empties into the Outlaw Marsh.  A family of trolls has taken possession of the place, and their patchwork and repairs stand out as inferior quality compared to the original construction.  The trolls are also busy digging out caves and dens under the bridge.  The trolls demand a toll from anyone wishing to cross, though they make exceptions for forces from the goblin kingdom.  A squad of gobin troops is camped nearby to watch travelers, help keep the trolls protected, and to get a cut of the tolls they collect.


Trollwood (-3,-5)
A small band of woods-trolls live on this peninsula.

True Mirage of Al-Hassir Affat (-3,5)
	Out in the desert, past the camps of the nomads, caravans tell tales of a mirage that is real, of a necropolis that appears out of nowhere and vanishes, taking treasures and people away with it.
	The necropolis palace of Al-Hassir Affat is steeped in ancient magics. Minotaur skeletons patrol the area, animated mummies converse as if still breathing, and secret catacombs hint at lost artifacts.
	Scholars debate the relationship between the Shards of the Lost Lady and the Mirage. Adventurers and raiders test their fate at a chance for fortune and glory. Few return. Some come back… changed.
Tubtub (1,9)
It’s not much of a town, but you can buy some supplies and take a hot bath.  This glorified shanty town has built up over time around a small natural hot springs.  The hot waters are a welcome respite in the cold wastes.  The town is populated by humans and other travelers who trade and work closely with the frost elves of Chill Hold.  A small trickle of rich tourists have begun to arrive recently due to rumors about the hot spring’s healing properties.

The Ryokan de Tubtub is the only 2-story building in the community.  It is built atop a natural rock pool with its own self-contained hot spring (which flows in and drains away in the sandy, pebbly layer beneath the water).  Those not visiting at the Ryokan make do with staying in one of a number of other small facilities (hostels and guest houses) which border on the Tubtub Brook.

Underwater Jungle of Tropswe-la (-5,4) and (-5,3)
	This unusual biome might be called a rainforest due to its sheer biodiveristy and density of species… except it is underwater. Many species of underwater seaweed trees, fruit-bearing corals, and dark kelps are the home for water-breathing tigers, colorful bird-fishes, aqua-arboreal things like octopi, and countless other oceanic insects and small crustaceans. The octopi have social structure, language and something like an upside-down boat to go fishing for seagulls, complete with hydrogen-based lighter-than-air lures.
There is no word from the dolphin tribes about the science or magic that caused this fruitful area, but it is slowly getting larger.


The Urgent Reach (6,4)
	A mountain range that is surprisingly fertile, with post-volcanic surface soil stratified in deep pockets. This fertile soil helped to provide food for desperate refugees many years ago. The center of the Reach contains an old, dormant volcano that erupted centuries ago. Some scholars claim that there's a portal to an elemental plane there.
Update: The portal to the elemental plane located in the mountains has slowly began to swallow up the fertile surface soil surrounding it, then replacing it with that off desert sand. Could this be the end to using the mountains to for farm land?

To the people of Xitz, the stones represent a hometown curiosity -- a popular picnic destination. But to the savages from the lands surrounding, the monoliths are important. These people come to Vitonen on their holy days to venerate the stones’ spirits. During these festivals, most of the Xitzis give them a wide berth.

Wandering Woods (3,-7)
	In the shadows of the Dizzying Aerie, far from the reaches of the ice trolls, on the shores of a forgotten cove, here may be found the Wandering Woods. It is impossible to build anything through it, for the trees shift like dunes to hide roads and bury villages. The very trees change positions, perhaps in alignment with lost stars on the other side of the world, but none have seen them move directly. Chalk marks on trees may be sometimes found as the remnants of lost cartographers, but they are never in the same position as the trees do their impossible hidden ballet.
	Do not cut down a living tree. Do not attempt to replant a sapling.

The Watched Wood (-3,-4) and (-2,-4)
This forest is rumored to be haunted.  The thick canopy of leaves makes the forest dark and full of shadows.  There is movement among the trees.  These woods are home to a great host of wildlife, but no one hunts here; no one dares.  There is something else in the woods, and travelers hurry though because they can feel it watching them.  Many travelers prefer to wait until winter, when the forest seems more open, empty, and safe.
This forest is protected by the Hyleoroi wood nymphs, the watchers of the wood.  They tolerate neither hunter nor lumberjack, and take steps to protect these woods from tool users.  They are aware of the followers of the Green Lady and have made an agreement with Oshanna Soramalin allowing them to live hidden here so long as they help to protect and care for the woods.


Waveless Shallows (-3,8)


Way of the Navigator* (Naavik ke Raaste) (-2,-4)
Notable NPCs: Oshanna Soramalin,
A magical stopping point due east of the Abraxas Tower, a clearing in the middle of the forest where a beautiful statue points the way. This statue can help you navigate the forest easily or direct to you to certain doom on the road to Abraxas Tower. Travelers should be wise to show their truthful nature, whatever it may be- scoundrel, peacemaker or scholar. When stopping to rest at this fork in the road, the true you is the only one who shall make it through.

 Zaleb and Afik were twins born on either side of a solar eclipse who, independent of each other created the nearly perfectly paired stone sphinxes on either side of the Wysswhynn Strait.  These came to be known as the Sphinxes of the Straits; two almost perfectly matched sculptures nearly 30 feet tall, carved of the native stone, and each facing out and across the waters to where its twin sits.

Xir** (3,3 and surrounding tiles)
Notable NPCs: Logan Karn, Jason Bywar,

Once a mighty fortress, Xir was brought low not by military action, but be a gradual restructuring of the neighboring settlements that provided it wealth and materials. Now Xir is inhabited largely by plant and animal life that make their homes in its former streets and buildings. The palaces of the former rulers of Xir are often toured by travelling pilgrims, as the once tamed and renowned gardens have fully taken over and are said to be even more splendid now that they are unrestrained.

Xochev Ice Shelf (3,9)
The most populous obviously intelligent life are tribes of ice nomads who follow flocks of large flightless birds as they migrate across the ice shelf. The large slime colonies and white puddings that prey upon both birds and nomads exhibit signs of motive and intelligence, but make no effort to communicate in ways perceptible to the nomads.

Y’Ber Aquaponic Farm (6,7)
The empire of Y’Ber have advanced by leaps and bounds, not only do they make use of the land efficiently, the scientist have found a way to use water without having to transport it from the natural resting place.

Yondalao Trench (-6,-3 and spans many tiles)


The Yondalao trench was formed over many years of a massive sea serpent pacing along it, gradually widening and deepening the hole. Many years ago an adventurer managed to pierce the sea serpent's ballast air sacs, which prevented it from rising without a lethal amount of energy expenditure. However, it has recently managed to heal and refill its air sacs somehow and can now ascend to the surface to attack anything in its domain. Several ships have been lost, pieces of whales have appeared along the coasts, and fisherman refuse to approach the trench. Some trick of instinct keeps the serpent near to the trench, and sailors fear that the beast may have laid eggs. The dolphin tribes are in council with their shamans to see what can be done, while a few insanely brave (or just insane) treasure-hunting scavenger groups plot to see what has been uncovered in the trench.
