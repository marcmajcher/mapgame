The Isthmus of Sihgnithel (6,2)
The Sihgnithellians are a nomadic people who live close to the moving oddities called The Obsidian Pentad.  Some outsiders claim that this area is cursed and avoid travelling here.  When approached, the nomads of Sihgnithel are friendly and pleasant to talk to; they laugh off the “curse” as mere superstition.  They will happily give directions and share their food, drink, and lodging with travelers in need.  They will also take every opportunity to separate individual strangers away from their companions so that they can more easily be overwhelmed, captured, or killed while taking care to keep the other outsiders calm and oblivious.  Keeping their murderous intentions hidden is paramount.  They don’t always try to kill everyone they meet, obviously that would draw too much suspicion, but if the situation presents itself…  

Ideally, the victim is captured and sacrificed later by elders in an elaborate ceremony at one of the five ever drifting, slowly rotating, six-pointed obsidian structures known as The Obsidian Pentad.  However, blood is blood, and slitting a stranger’s throat while they lie sleeping is better than nothing.

“Twisty Horns and Thirsty Fangs” - Their demonic patrons are never called by name.  Instead the nomads use this phrase when referring to their demonic masters.  Also, the nomads will quietly whisper this phrase to each other along with a sharp nod and a quick look as an easy shorthand that means “Those are strangers, come help me kill them and we will both attain glory in the eyes of our unholy lords.”

Until the people began to abuse the roselettes by cutting too much and not respecting what the roselette meant to the kingdom. In retaliation to the disrespect, they began to grown wildly and became more intrusive. Beautiful large leafed plant life with colorful roses at their center. These colorful flowers are used as a means to attract the food the roselettes live on. Not able to control their growth anymore, the people of the kingdom started to burn them instead of cutting and that is when the roselettes grew thorns, no longer allowing the people to get close enough to inflicted any harm to the plants. This was the first action to trigger the change that would eventually allow the plant and animal life to take over the kingdom of Xir.
