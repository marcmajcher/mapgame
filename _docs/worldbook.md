Blazeholm (0,-8)
Burncrab Dale (3, -1)
Bridges of Chazonkómena (-9,-3)
Chill Hold (2,9)
	Chill Hold is primarily inhabited by elves who dwell beneath and within the glacier covering the coast. A minority population of evolved penguin-like birds dwell on the surface, plus a shanty-town of travelers who have come to trade with the indigenous peoples.
Citystate of Xir (3,3)
Cuevoygua (-2,7)
Demesne of the Waire (-10,4)
Descrulin Outpost (5,8)
Militaristic and somewhat xenophobic, the inhabitants of the Outpost do not willingly allow outsiders within their borders.  The citizens wear enveloping robes or closed armor which protects them from the sun when abroad, leading many to assume their native habitat may be subterranean. Their hierarchy seems to be lead by robed wizards or priests intent on building a complex system of roads and monuments.
Dominion of the Undying One* (-2,3)
Notable NPCs: Zarek.  No description yet.
Emirate of Douban (0,-4)
The Vizier of the Emirate has set her sights on the tactical advantages of the Low Hills; it is fortunate that the peaks are beautiful and the nearby plains are extremely arable land.
Espand (-2,-3)
The society of Espand was based on the principles of competence and responsibility.  Their government was a meritocracy where the most skilled or able members ran the government.  In recent generations a caste of administrators have quietly solidified their grip on all the key governmental positions, and many of the minor ones.  Unchecked, this may lead to class stratification into a feudal or royalist government.  A growing religious movement has lead those dissatisfied with this state of affairs to gather under the banner of the Pinkest Sun in High Holy Espana.
Free State of Leng (0,1)
The Free State of Leng takes its name from the massive stone head of Leng that juts out of the Holozodu plateau. Its seat of power is the stone keep just across the Mason’s Highway. The young fairy queen currently holds court in both the Maw of Leng and in the stone keep, varying with the seasons. The mists that veil the land are clear to those who have the queen’s favor, and travellers vie for her good graces in an annual tournament.
Goblin Kingdom (1,2)
The Goblins have returned!  They are rebuilding their ruins within the goblin woods and have made a shaky alliance with the trolls who live in the woods.  The trolls help bolster their forces during night raids, and this has helped them to quickly expand their territory.  They've recently taken control of both Trollbruckle and the Lake of Echoes causeway and are now demanding tolls from anyone wishing to cross either of them.
High Bank Tiwayaen (-5,3)
High Holy Espana (0, -1)
	High Holy Espana has raised their Pinkest Sun icon above the peaks, literally moving part of the mountain to place it overlooking the tiny High Hills Camp. With this success, more of the faithful have come to the location. The mine, which translates to the Cave of Wisdom, will funnel the wealth of the entire mountain ridge into the local community. Part of the people’s faith involves a pilgrimage into the lake known as The Hole in the World. The whole area is relatively free from raiders and bandits, for reasons the faithful do not volunteer.
Principality of Zareff (1,4)
               The inhabitants of Zareff are known as the Sand People, they use the surrounding desert to create a variety of building materials of which they use for their city and trade with other empires. They also create one of a kind items bartered and sold to enrich the economy and wealth of the principality.     
Sahonan Locks (6,2)
Sclean Protectorate (-2,-1)
Schippley Island (-2,-11)
Sirrithial, the Fluttering Theocracy (1,-7)
               Sirrithial was originally founded by pilgrims who were impressed by the Feast of the Butterflies and hoped to join the ranks of the Shai.  They lay claim to all the lands circled by the migration of the butterflies, and so their borders have shifted a bit over time.  The leaders of Blazeholm have always said that such claims are ridiculous, and New Blaze was built in an area within the usual flightpath.  Last year, the butterflies flew much further south and west than normal, going deep into Blazeholm territory.  A growing number of the faithful say that this is a sign, and that the butterflies are demanding war.   Tensions run high.
Strait of Yondalao (-6,-2)
Thessaline Peoples, The (-12,-2)
United Coastal Peoples of Nila (2,-4)
The Broken Reach (-5,1)
The Y’Ber Empire (6,6)
