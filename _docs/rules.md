Instructions to take your turn:

1. Update your turn column with the current turn. If there's an x in your Queue column, remove it. Reduce your 'Missed' value to 0.

2. If there were any players who failed to respond to a summons for 24+ hours, between the previously taken turn and right now (other than you), add 1 to the number in the 'Missed' column for each of them and remove any 'x' next to their names in the queue column. Any players who were incremented up to three consecutive missed turns are moved below to the list of inactive players. (The changes in these two steps will randomly set your three available actions on the "Action Randomizer" tab.)

3. Choose one or two actions from the list on the Action Randomizer tab. Use any Choice Tokens now! Any edit to the spreadsheet will randomize your actions again, so note them elsewhere and make the changes once your turn is done. The easiest way to to this is to select the cells A2:E4 and right-click copy, then select the cells A6:E8 and right click PASTE SPECIAL - PASTE VALUES ONLY.

4. Perform the actions you chose, following their instructions.

When you have to edit the map, please do the following in order:
        a. In Google Drive, right-click, Make a copy of the drawing called "Master Map". This copy will be an archive of how the map was when it came to you.
        b. Rename the new copy like map00nnn (but using the map number you just updated). Verify the number based on the other map archives that have been created, just in case.
        c. Update the Master Map with whatever changes you make as part of your turn.
        d. If there are more than three old map00nnnn in the folder, drag any older archive copies into the Map Archives folder to keep things tidy.
        e. If you added one or more tiles to the map, update the list of coordinates on the 'map randomizer' tab of this spreadsheet.

5. Post a note to the Turns Submitted category of the G+ community, headed by your turn number in bold (*Use asterisks* for bold), describing your turn. Remember to summon the next player by tagging them in your post (use +Player Name). (NOTE! If you tag a person during a post edit, they will not be notified. You'll need to tag them in a comment in order to send the notification.)

6. Determining the next player:
        a. If there are any players in the queue (with an x in their queue column) who also have availability (the time when you are ending your turn is described by the text in their availability column), summon ALL queued players. If not...
        b. Go down the list from your name (or the name of the person who summoned you, if you were in queue), ignoring people with any red-backed data, jumping to the top when you get to the bottom, until you find someone currently available. Summon that player. Set the queue column to an 'x' for everyone you skipped over due to non-availability.

7. Instructions to get someone to take a turn (anyone should feel free to do this!):
        1. If you notice that it has been over 24 hours since a player was summoned to take their turn, or that none of the previously summoned players will be available (per their availability description) before the 24 hours would elapse, go ahead and summon the next player(s).
        2. In this case, "the next player(s)" consists of everyone who has been summoned since the last turn was played, in addition to:
                a. ALL the available players in the queue who have not yet been summoned OR
                b. the next player going down the list, starting at the player who played the last turn, who is available and has not yet been summoned.

8. If anyone's Missed column increments up to 3, replace their Availability with n/a and move them down into the bottom part of the list for historic players who've moved on. Adjust the turn order as needed.
