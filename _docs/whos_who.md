Abrasax, the Sky Dragon (Abrasax Tower) [-3,-4]
Abrasax the Wise, Abrasax the Untouchable, Abrasax the Merciful, Abrasax the Wastelayer... It is impossible to separate fact from rumor when it comes to the merciful and kind sky dragon, who can raise the dead, consume whole villages before the sun is full high in the sky, whose very tears are gold and can command the magic of the sky and the elves.

Indisputably, Abrasax is not to be disturbed by anything insignificant. Only it can say for certainty what is significant, but the path to the tower is paved with bones. Tread with caution.


Alae’im (Goblin Wood) [1,1]
Alae’im is the old woman that everybody in Silverwatch has heard of, the one that lives on the verge of the Goblin Wood. She has a reputation that is based on her odd choice of home, and the fact that her appearance is strange. This is due to her having a small amount of goblin blood in her veins, and eyes that seem to change color every few minutes. To say nothing of the good deal of rather ostentatious jewelry that she wears.

There are some that say she’s a witch, but this is simply not true. Though she does seem to have a great sense of the woods, knowing its plants well. She makes various concoctions from the flora of Goblin Wood, including some potent poisons. She puts these poisons on darts, and uses them to defend herself from anything that might stumble out of the wood (especially any Trolls that might forget she’s not defenseless). Outside of her work with herbs and such, she leads a very slothful life, eating from her gardens and an orchard that she seems to be able to attend to effortlessly. What she does do, she’s extremely good at.

Her few visitors are people who want to know about the woods. Being rather lonely, she will talk with them as long as they’ll let her, looking for gossip. Her pet peeve, however, are folks who tell tales of tortured pasts, since hers is likely a lot worse, and she burdens nobody with it.

She’s especially fond of noble folk, who she’ll do her best to impress, for reasons known only to her. She believes that Fate has lead her to where she is, and that one cannot fight Fate. She also loves the wind, and spends more effort on going for walks to high places than anything else.

Alyssa (Alyssa’s Prison) [4,0]
Alyssa escaped from the prison ages ago, but has not aged at all in that time. The sorcerer who imprisoned her wanted her torment to last forever, and “gifted” her with functional immortality. The idea was that she’d suffer in the prison for eternity; the sorcerer honestly never thought that she’d escape. She’s spent the last few decades researching the true nature of the prison, and is looking for people to help her destroy it before a certain celestial event…

Rumors have come that Alyssa is currently in the Principality of Zareef, with rumors of taking an expedition into the Dominion of the Undying One. For what purpose?

Captain Ara Windsal (Ironcoast) [5, 6] - [1, 4] - [-2,7] - [-4,7]

Captain Windsal was a notorious pirate who plundered major shipping lanes for years before being sunk by a large naval fleet a decade ago. His dying ship ran aground on the Iron coast before being destroyed by naval fire and magic. The captain’s hate wouldn’t end with his death, and now his ghost ship lives on! For many years, Windsal was stuck, reenacting his final day: attack a nearby oceangoing vessel most nights experience his horrible death at dawn. Recently, however, a necromancer of some sort has untethered him from this cycle and he has expanded his haunting range, terrorizing the seas between Ironcoast and the Principality of Zareff at (1,4). Poor Captain Windsal’s disloyal crew seek only to escape and move on to whatever afterlife will have them.

Most recently there have been rumors of a ghost ship around the edges of Cuevoygua-controlled waters, and disappearances of small ships and a cargo freight seem to liken the stories of Captain Windsal’s uncontrolled expanse.

The Cuevoygua navy reports that Captain Windsal’s ghost ship The Revenant has been driven away thanks to clever magics and holy fire. They followed the ghost ship west to the Hypnosquid Mating Zone before giving up the chase. Cuevoygua naval command is confident that the pirates will perish there, but the wizard and priests helping them worry that the undead may be immune to the hypnosquids psionic blasts.


Chief Arlas (High Hills) [0,-1]
The mountain herdsmen of the High Hills have many “chiefs” which translate roughly as ‘herd masters’. Of special note is Arlas, one of the youngest chiefs in living memory. Arlas has been instrumental in attracting new buyers to the trade fairs she organizes to sell their tribal products, and purchase new animals improving the health of her herd. Her new, outward focused drive to interact with strangers and traders does not sit well with more conservative chiefs who see their herds shrink as families move their animals to Arlas’ herd.

Braniah Unnyal (Burncrab Dale) [3,-1], (New Blaze) [0, -7]  
A strikingly attractive Choraku (privileged class of people with innate magic abilities) from Burncrab Dale who has a reputation for underhanded schemes. Rumors say that she has great admiration for entertainers, and is regularly seen hanging out with that sort. She can usually be found in the Brewer and Wand tavern. Very tall, with freckles and a halo of brown hair, she stands out in the crowd, often mistaken for an entertainer herself.

She spends her days making bets on anything and everything, and listening to stories the entertainers tell (she’s particularly fond of those where the heroes have painful pasts, as she likes to feel that she’s commiserating with them). Part of her reputation for schemes has to do with the fact that she never seems to actually work, despite having been trained as a smith doing artwork in iron. That, and the fact that she is, in fact, a schemer, who spends a lot of time avoiding the authorities whose rules she would rather not follow.

Unknown to all, Braniah is a vampire. She has returned to Burncrab Dale in order to seek revenge on certain of her friends who she feels failed her when she was mortal. She went into business with them, and, being very materialistic, had high hopes that the venture would produce great riches. It did not. While her eventual goal is for this malice to result in the demise of these friends, before that happens she is looking to have some playfully mischievous fun with them. Toying with them before the kill, essentially, as just killing them would be letting them off easy. She’s also hoping to profit from these plans, as she still has an eye for silver.

Despite her powers as a vampire, Braniah was never a very competent person in life, and this remains the case. While she’s clever, she’ll seek out PCs to aid her in her schemes, and put them in the forefront, coming forth only at the end for the kill, likely. She possesses an axe that she will use to defend herself, not being fully confident of being able to rely solely on her vampire abilities to accomplish these deeds.

Her plot, as it currently stands, is to get her friends involved in a rescue mission for one of their other friends (who she’ll kidnap, or better yet, have a PC kidnap). The mission will involve going to the town’s funeral pit, where they’ll be told they have to fight an evil spirit for entrance to an otherworldly place where the missing friend is being held - not at all true. What they’ll really be doing is fighting one of their own ancestors and entering a sacred realm of the dead, a sacrilegious act that will result in a curse on the town. Once word gets out that they’ve done this, their names and those of their families will be besmirched for ages.

Update: After hearing rumors of a vampire in New Blaze that may be able to help her with the plot she has concocted to trap her friends, Braniah decides to book travel to Fort Hampoole in the Emirate of Douban where she stops to pick up herbs that will be needed for the sleeping potion used with this plan. From there Braniah books travel across the strait then on to New Blaze.    

Caramel the Sleepless (Cathesa Cove) [11,1]




Cassi (Issac & Cassi’s Dreamhold) [-7, 1]







The Crazy Old Hermit (Gate of the Gods) [1, -6]
Nobody knows where this guy came from, or what his actual name is, but he’s been living in a small cave on the beach for the past twenty or so years. Every day at sunset he performed strange rituals (which are different every time) that he never explained. Locals sometimes brought him offerings for “good luck,” and were protective of the old man from those who’d bother him for any reason.

That was until one day this morning ritual ended with him turning on his heel three times and straight up walking all the many leagues to the Feast of Butterflies. He strode past the caretakers there into the midst of the butterflies and was quickly blanketed. Now he sits, apparently sustained by the carpet of butterflies, motionless. Some folk who left him offerings in his hermitage now have joined the pilgrimage to the Feast to pay respects there. News of his journey has begun to make its way across the lands around the Feast; some wise people say it is all very ominous - of what, they cannot say.

Czar of the Seas (Rocky Beach) [6, -4]
A madman wanders the shoreline at Rocky Beach, cursing the waves, and scanning the horizon, searching for ships. He wears a tattered admiral's uniform and answers to the title of Czar of the Seas.

The Yewcrown, Datur Wyrdtoci (Lagoon of the World Tree) [-3,-3]
Datur is bound to serve the Great Kossuth as the Yewcrown, tasked to assist the Great Kossuth in its duty to protect the Lagoon. She dearly misses her home and family across the waters, but understands the necessity of sourcing the needed naturally fallen timbers for the vast Bridges.

Dax (Imboca) [5,0]
Dax, originally a creature of the sea, was caught up in the magic that created and helps to maintain the sea-born city of Imboca. His school was present when the Sorcerer cast his spell catching several of them in the magic which gave them humanoid features and the ability to talk. Dax was the only one to stay fearing the world would not accept them like the inhabitants of Imboca. Making a life from himself in the floating city, Dax has become one of the most important citizens helping and sharing in the daily chores of maintaining the city.











Dinrael Bospher (Fallen Star) [-2,-3]
Dinrael Bospher, the keeper of the Sea Needle, the lighthouse of Vitonen, is a quiet man in his middle age, with strong arms and a neatly trimmed greying beard. He is kind and hospitable to those who find themselves on the little spit of land he lives on, but he doesn’t seek out human company very often otherwise. He has a great whirling host of seabirds that bring him news from all across the waters, and he is knowledgeable about many things in this manner.

Some say Dinrael is secretly a weather mage, wielding mighty storms and mild days for his own private reasons, but that is surely the superstitions of travelers who are not familiar with the ways of the sea. He kept the lighthouse lit by a many faceted mirror which reflects the light of a golden fire, flashing out across the sea night after night after night. By day he rests, tends his garden and his three goats, collects seabird eggs, and drags up from the rocks whatever lost thing has gone afoul despite the warning light. If it is human, and he finds it alive, it will most certainly live, as he is adept in healing arts. If it is dead, he buries the poor soul in a little graveyard at the southwest edge of the spit, where the winds are slightly softer. So far in his time, there have been nine graves filled.

Lately, Dinrael financed an expedition to take him to the Fallen Star (-2, -3). He won’t say why exactly, but he was clearly in a hurry to get there. He’s deflected any questions as to his reasons, giving half-answers and trying to pass it off as an “academic interest”, but his eagerness and desire for strong bodyguards made people wary.

Recently, Dinrael has arrived at the Fallen Star. He left his daughter, Gazania, in charge of the Lighthouse.

Dodyrune (The Hole in the World) [1,-1]

Sitting on the edge, with his legs dangling into the void, meditates a ragged, homely child. The sigil of a green, arcane eye is tattooed upon his forehead. His other eyes, also green, glare in annoyance at those who interrupt his trance.

This child is actually a time traveling pilgrim who has paused to rest and contemplate this age's anomaly on his journey through the eras. Dodyrune can see the past of those he meets, so he will warm to those who truly mean him no harm.

If asked where he is from and how he came to this place, the child will make reference to Xir, a grand castle of onyx spires built upon the plain far to the north and east. As part of his education, he was instructed by his teacher to “Look upon the world as it is made, as it is unmade, and as it lays fallen.” This century, says Dodyrune, is one of the first he has visited. Gesturing toward the Hole, he asks (in an odd blend of existentialism and childlike innocence) if this is a part of the world yet to be born, or a part that has already died.

If Dodyrune is asked or told to accompany someone, he smiles and agrees, but vanishes soon after. Childish laughter can be heard lingering in the air where he disappeared for a moment. Dodyrune will see them again, many years later for them, but not for himself.	 	 	 


Sorcerer Emeron (Imboca) [5,0]
 A sorcerer who came to his powers late, he traveled the lands looking for a permanent home since he had been exiled from his own. Finally finding one with the residents of Imboca, he has become a stanch advocate for the inhabitants of the wayward island. No one actually knows where he is originally from but there are whispers that he may be from… Once Emeron felt comfortable in his new home, he began to advocate for the inhabitants which lead him to creating the Invisible Islands, a home to the Scoqwx and sea bridge to the Underdeep East.


Erling the Scavenger (Verranchass) [5,4]
	Shifty and treacherous, Erling is not a pleasant man.  He is out here looking for something, but is loathe to talk about it.  He’s confident that others will not recognize it’s value, so he’d rather not risk informing a possible competitor.  If pressed he’ll admit that he was sent personally by Logan Karn, so go talk to him if you want details.  Erling would rather look for the item alone, he doesn’t care to share the profits once it is found.


Etta Whitegrief (Bridges Of Chazonkómena) [-9,-3]
	Etta Whitegrief is tasked with sourcing some of the most significant woods and other materiel for the Bridges’ extensive bas-reliefs. Her leadership position is earned after years of dedication and study. Her lover, Datur Wyrdtoci, is currently bound to serve at the Yewcrown at the Lagoon of the World Tree.






Fanapadryaped (Petrified Ice Giants) [-4,-4]

Lorem ipsum.







Captain Felicity Moonflower (Jim’s Hoard) [-3,1] Lagoon of the World Tree(3,-3)
Felicity Moonflower is a privateer sailing the treacherous southeastern sea around Cranston's Reef. She gained notoriety in the Great Escape from Alyssa's Prison several years ago. The merchant princes of Burncrab Dale and Baxter's Bay have placed sizable bounties on both her and her ship, the Burning Queen. This four-masted galleon is crewed by several members of Moonflower's extended family, and is armed with enchanted guns. No one has come close to collecting on the bounties as of yet, and only a few outside of her ship's crew know the location of the hidden harbor where the Burning Queen docks on the reef.

Update:
Spies from the dale eventually managed to locate the Burning Queen’s berth, so she now sails from Jim’s Hoard, plying the Sinistratum Strait and the waters further South.
Update: Hearing of the sea trade conference hosted by the Emirate of Douban, the captain decided to dock her ship on the shores of the Lagoon of the World Tree, where it would be say from prying eyes because of its majestic invisible waters. Felicity is tired of running and has decided that it is time to find a way to get the bounties on her and her family taken care of. Traveling by land which would be quicker and further give the cover they needed to make it to the Emirate. She is hoping one of the visiting monarchs will all them exile and safety from the merchant princes of Burncrab Dale and Baxter's Bay .  




Gazania Bospher (Sea Needle) [2,4]
Considered one of the great beauties of the realm, Gazania is the daughter of Dinrael Bospher, the keeper of the Sea Needle, the great Lighthouse near Vitonen. She is well-versed in healing magics, and necromancy. It is not uncommon for the dead to assist her in keeping the lighthouse.

Recently, a cargo vessel called 'Pegasus Wilde' foundered in a storm and was wrecked on the rocks near the Sea Needle. Almost the entire crew perished, but one sailor named Edwin Forefax, a junior officer on his first voyage on this ship, survived, although he was gravely injured. He was brought to the Sea Needle by four of his dead shipmates who died in the wreck and the storm, but whose bodies were animated by Gazania’s necromantic charms which ring the region.

Since that tragic wreck, Gazania has been caring for Edwin, and is slowly nursing him back to health. While she has widely studied necromantic magics, Gazania was, nonetheless, very surprised when the four zombies carrying their nearly dead comrade arrived at the Sea Needle in the midst of the terrible storm. She is more than a little intrigued by what magical entanglements bound these dead crew to this young man and brought him to her.


Hissuth Aldremage (Netzali’s Eye) [-11,-3]
  Lore ipsum

Lockmaster Imur N'lantha (Bricklayers Canal) [5,1]
The Lockmaster has forged a tense peace by lording over the pirates, traders, caravaneers, and bandits that roam the Bricklayers Canal. As far as anyone knows, he is a plain vanilla mortal human with no magic, just an indomitable will, a sense of honor, and a lust for power. He appears young but has crushed the uprising of many more of the criminal elements, uniting them with largely bloodless strategems.The motto “Coin is king and life is short” is incorporated into his coat of arms.
N’Lantha’s current projects include building up the defenses and markets surrounding the Canal and sending explorers and scholars to investigate the rumors of a great nothing to the far south. He has a weakness for a good debate about natural philosophy, even when he is wrong.



Isyarae Tuik Edu Sae of Cynmhain (Free State of Leng,) [0,0]
It’s openly whispered that this young fairy queen took power after a vicious and bloody coup. She nurtures all rumors, and her court is a deadly maze of intrigue and favor.

Unusually, she held her seasonal courts in two locations: one in the Maw of Leng itself, and one in the area around stone keep recently lost to the Goblins. She will lose much face if the next seasonal court and its tournament cannot be held there.

She is a master of glamor and illusions, and a fair hand with controlling the weather- even to the point of conducting “weather orchestras” for the viewing pleasure of her subjects.

She has also taken neither consort nor concubine since ascending to the throne, but does not lack for suitors.

Jason Bywar (Xir) [3,3]

Lorem ipsum



Kilgrave the Dragon (Bronze Archipelago) [-2,-10] (Blazeholm) [-1,-8] Mount Goragas [-5,-7]

The shrewd Kilgrave, who roosts in the Bronze Archipelago(-2,-10) in on the move. First,  the wily wyrm landed in Blazeholm- the up-and-coming kingdom accepted the dragon’s gold and jewels in payment for food and sundries. And none dare ask why the dragon went shopping instead of raiding and pillaging. Whispers abounded as to the true motive of the creature, but so far, none have openly confronted Kilgrave about its true agenda. At least, not that they’re talking.
Kilgrave abruptly left Blazeholm to attend an “urgent personal matter” in the volcanic Mount Goragas. Immediately, the augurs of Blazeholm attempted to divine its motives, and the gambling-halls had a merry run on outcomes. Goragas is evidently active, sending huge plumes of ash into the air, and rivulets of lava steadily roll down the volcano. A passing sky-barge reportedly saw Kilgrave dive directly to the mouth of the volcano, but it held fast and lit at a cave entrance near the top before disappearing into the cave structure. Before leaving, the crew of the sky-barge also saw an unusual dark blue and green hot air balloon, radiating arcane energy, on a course for Goragas, but it changed course into a cloud bank and was lost.
Why does Kilgrave the clever evidently have a meeting with a hot air balloonist?


Great Kossuth (Lagoon of the World Tree) [-3,-3]

A treant who is bound to protect and maintain the area around the Lagoon. The self-described “Great” Kossuth is rooted in place, but his roots spread out for about half a mile past the edges of the lagoon. “He” can see and hear through his roots, and can control plant life in and around the Lagoon itself. He can also exert control over beasts, but it’s harder and tends to drive the animals into a frenzy.

Kractahl the Bard (Scelan Heights) [-1,-1] and [0,-1] Douban Keep (0,-3)
A poor and wandering minstrel, Kractahl is the founder of a scattered and ragtag troupe performers known as The Karnivahli. He plays an enchanted harp, and with it he is able to compose enjoyable, if simple, melodies when others merely strum the strings. He has used this trick to elicit donations out of travelers along the roads where he roams and hides out from the local authorities.

For Kractahl, everything revolves around his music. In the spring, the flowers around him go into full bloom at the sound of his harp. But he does not play only for travelers; nature spirits can often be glimpsed listening to him at the edge of his music. There are rumors that Kractahl may be part nature spirit himself, stemming both from his wayward appearance and the odd way he says certain things; often making confusing statements that sound like questions. If accosted by a noble's guards, or insulted by travelers, he is known to shout “I must go lest the red tempest comes!” before dashing off into the undergrowth, leaving no trace of his passing.

Recently, a village child in the High Hills (one known to be touched) ran in fear from Kractahl’s recital in the square and later declared to her father that the bard is a monster of red smoke and black flame. This has added to the local buzz regarding the strange visitor.

After this declaration, the villagers attributed many weeks of strange happenings to the Karnivahli troupe, and specifically Kractahl. They were banished from the village after the touched child made a prophecy to the eldest matriarch. Kractahl threw the bones and led the troupe south over the Low Hills and down the Traders’ Highway with haste, making camp just near to Douban Keep in order to “entertain and illuminate” the populace. He’s hoping that he will be able to steal away some talent from the Emirate and add it to his troupe before moving on, ideally before news catches up with him.

K’thrax (Invisible Islands) [5,0] and now moved to [5,2]
Many an unwary seafarer have been lured to their deaths by promises of wishes granted by K’thrax, the Sea Dragon. They say each ship he downs expands the reach of his stone circle.

Travelers reported K’thrax’s passage through the Bricklayer’s Canal took close to two full days, his rippling scales filling the canal and causing minor flooding as he made his way northward. None dared stop him to ask for toll or his business in the northern seas.

The armada destined for Burncrab Dale never arrived… and K’thrax’s stone circle now intrudes upon Alyssa’s Prison, threatening its stability.



Kwan Wildpetal (Ironcoast) [5, 6] (Bricklayers’ Canal) [5,1] Imboca (5,0)

She's wandering the world cataloging all of the creatures to be found. At first, it didn't seem like this was a useful thing, but now she can visit a tribe or a kingdom and share wisdom about other creatures she's encountered throughout that have similar traits. She peddles advice on how to keep populations in control, how to hunt more effectively, and how to prevent invasive species. So naturally she's hands-on, and inquisitive, and orderly.

She struggles with all the languages out there (there are so many!) but can usually find someone within a kingdom or tribe that will work with her. In fact, many of the diagrams and drawings of the various species are drawn by the people she meets.

Sadly, a serious injury had required her to go home to recuperate, at the Ironcoast. She has since recuperated with the aid of her extensive herbal and medicinal lore, and is now on her way to explore the so-called Feast of the Butterflies. She had booked passage on a fantastic exploratory vessel and spent some time in the Bricklayer’s Canal area working on her languages before moving along.

Kwan has now taken up residence for a season at Imboca after securing passage on a song-magic schooner, the Sparkling Dulcimer. The tapestry of the orchestra allows it to penetrate the protective spells around Imboca itself. Many of the people are hungry for news of the outside world, so she has easily been able to trade stories for most of her needs, but teaching languages on the side for a modest income. Here in Imboca, she has learned of Scoqwyx to the west from a former member of its hive.


Logan Karn (Xir) [3,3]
Possibly the most infamous merchant in the sprawling citystate of Xir, Logan is the man to see if you can’t find something anywhere else. For a price he will provide anything you ask for, payment up front, no returns, no refunds.

The crown of fire long since colored or covered to hide what line you belong to, Mirian decided not to hide her crown or lineage and to embrace what her ancestors left to her. Not just a path to royalty and government, the crown of fire also shows of a long dormant power the ancestors of Blazeholm possessed when it was necessary to protect the kingdom from outside influences. No one living has ever seen this power in action but Mirian hopes to access, harness and use this power to give her family their rightful place in the Blazeholm.

Hearing of a meeting for the leaders of the southern continent, Mirian decides this may be the best time to get acquainted with the leaders whom she hopes to rubs shoulders with on her journey to becoming ruler of Blazeholm.

Se’Fowin was just the man for him, making his living as a statesman among other things, Povoway had just the right connections needed to bring the new village out of its infancy and help with the expansion of the BlazeHolm kingdom.

Shailana (The Feast of The Butterflies) [1,-6] and [2,-6] now [0,-4]

A young woman of the legacy of the Shai, the ancestral safekeepers and tenders of the Feast of Butterflies. She is serious and quiet, but fiercely devoted to her family and the wonder they are entrusted to protect.

As the eldest child, Shailana is faced with a choice. Her youngest brother was born 4 years ago, which means that he will be counted among the Shai on his next name day. By tradition and prophecy, the numbers of the Shai must remain constant.

Therefore, Shailana must either marry and remain in her beloved home as part of the Shai, or leave to seek her fortune in the world. If she marries, it must be a pilgrim to the Feast and she must not speak with him first. If she leaves, she must depart suddenly, without telling anyone - father, mother, sisters: anyone - even that she is leaving, much less where she will go.

She finds none of her options even worthy of contemplation. She is becoming desperate as Shaigort’s name day approaches.

Recently she seized upon the sea trade conference hosted by the Emirate of Douban to send a missive to the Oshind Temple. She asked to join their order, finding neither marriage nor penniless wandering to her liking. She fears her strengths as a leader among the Shai may hamper their interest in her, but has few options remaining, unless one of the Shai dies before her brothers nameday.

Yondalao (Petrified Ice Giants) [-4,-4]

Greatest of the giants! Largest, strongest, wisest, oldest, most eloquent, most kind, most feared. There are many stories spun about Yondalao, how he lead his people in battle against the sea serpents and dragons, how they built the mountains and dug the rivers, how Yondalao plucked the sun from the sky to prove his people's greatness! And how, as all the world froze in darkness, Yondalao was struck with remorse, releasing the sun and taking the freezing cold into his proud people to spare the rest of the world his pride and foolishness. Or so it's told around the campfires of the ice nomads.



Zaleb and Afik (Wysswhynn Strait  -10,-8 and -11,-8)

Zaleb and Afik were twins born on either side of a solar eclipse (Zaleb born just before the sun was swallowed, and Afik born just after it had returned).  Though they shared many skills and personality traits, they each had a deep dislike for the other, each believing that their twin was an interloper from the wrong side of Time.  Afik was a homebody who never desired to travel, becoming immersed in art and craft taught by the local masters who were the finest experts in drawing and sculpture.  Zaleb, on the other hand, was filled with wanderlust, and took to the road as soon as possible, seeking the knowledge of a thousand scholars and experts across the world.

And yet, despite their differences, or perhaps because of their similarities, both fell in love with the same person, Jeswel Refferthorp (also known as Jes Reffer), a global merchant and dealer in precious art and artifacts.  But, of course, that romance came to a tragic end.    

After Jes Reffer's funeral, the twins settled in small villages (each with a population of exactly 101 people, at the time) on either side of the Wysswhynn Strait, and both began careers as stonecarvers, without knowledge of the other's activity creating what came to be known as the Sphinxes of the Straits; two almost perfectly matched sculptures nearly 30 feet tall, carved of the native stone, and each facing out and across the waters to where its twin sits.

Zaleb died at age 74, coincidentally just before another eclipse struck.  And Afik died the same day, and, not surprisingly, right after the eclipse ended.



Zarek (Outlaw Marsh) [2,3] and [2,2] Dominion of the Undying One (-2,3)

Everyone has a different story about Zarek. The wealthy traders plying the routes between the castles to the east and south avoid the marsh for fear of a shakedown. Those who dwell in the eastern castle fear he foments rebellion among the poorer classes there. Some say he’s already claimed the riches of Koestler’s cache, and that he knows the only way across the desert to the west. He was trained at the Oshind Temple before leading the Great Khan’s assault on Burncrab Dale. He saved the same dale against siege ships massed in Baxter’s Bay. He goes fishing in the strait, he cracked the cracked lands, he himself stirs the maelstrom with ancient magics. Everyone knows someone who’s met him, or raided with him, or run from him in battle, but no one will themselves admit to it. He is everywhere and nowhere. But if you hear a low whistling in the night, be on your guard. Everyone agrees that’s his signal.
	The latest rumors from a sand-ship caravan through the Sea of Sand, long thought lost but instead nearly wiped out, have come through to the Goblin Kingdom. They report that Zarek himself has made a camp of two thousand men at the edges of the Dominion of the Undying one. Some say he is there for immortality, some say he awaits Alyssa.





Zorba (Silverworth) [2,1]
Zorba, the goblin mage and chief Potions Mistress of Silverworth, is one of the few leaders who can undoubtedly prove her lineage to the founding of the city. Her reputation for power and skill is somewhat tarnished by persistent dishonest trade dealings, as she hungers for more power and knowledge. Her dealings have paid off, as city records and public mosaics prove that she is at least 228 years old.
	Despite her dishonestly, she is deeply anxious about the effects of the vast amounts of magical waste that pollute the city’s rivers. She commits undead gangs to work tirelessly on the cleanup, but it is a slow process. Zorba loves the city of Silverworth.
